        A class to wrap all information about a specific framework the library needs to quantize a model.
        Specifically, FrameworkInfo holds lists of layers by how they should be quantized, and multiple mappings such as
        layer to it kernel channels indices, and a layer to its min/max values, etc.
        The layers lists are divided into three groups:
        kernel_ops: Layers that have coefficients and need to get quantized (e.g., Conv2D, Dense, etc.)
        activation_ops: Layers that their outputs should get quantized (e.g., Add, ReLU, etc.)
        no_quantization_ops:Layers that should not get quantized (e.g., Reshape, Transpose, etc.)

        Args:
            kernel_ops (list): A list of operators that are in the kernel_ops group.
            activation_ops (list): A list of operators that are in the activation_ops group.
            no_quantization_ops (list): A list of operators that are in the no_quantization_ops group.
            activation_quantizer_mapping (Dict[QuantizationMethod, Callable]): A dictionary mapping from QuantizationMethod to a quantization function.
            weights_quantizer_mapping (Dict[QuantizationMethod, Callable]): A dictionary mapping from QuantizationMethod to a quantization function.
            kernel_channels_mapping (DefaultDict): Dictionary from a layer to a tuple of its kernel in/out channels indices.
            activation_min_max_mapping (Dict[str, tuple]): Dictionary from an activation function to its min/max output values.
            layer_min_max_mapping (Dict[Any, tuple]): Dictionary from a layer to its min/max output values.
            kernel_ops_attributes_mapping (DefaultDict): Dictionary from a framework operator to a list of its weights attirbutes to quantize.
            output_channel_index (ChannelAxis): Index of output channels of the model's layers (for computing statistics per-channel).

        Examples:
            When quantizing a Keras model, if we want to quantize the kernels of Conv2D layers only, we can
            set, and we know it's kernel out/in channel indices are (3, 2) respectivly:

            >>> import tensorflow as tf
            >>> kernel_ops = [tf.keras.layers.Conv2D]
            >>> kernel_channels_mapping = DefaultDict({tf.keras.layers.Conv2D: (3,2)})

            Then, we can create a FrameworkInfo object:

            >>> FrameworkInfo(kernel_ops, [], [], kernel_channels_mapping, {}, {})

            and pass it to :func:`~model_compression_toolkit.keras_post_training_quantization`.

            To quantize the activations of ReLU, we can create a new FrameworkInfo instance:

            >>> activation_ops = [tf.keras.layers.ReLU]
            >>> FrameworkInfo(kernel_ops, activation_ops, [], kernel_channels_mapping, {}, {})

            If we don't want to quantize a layer (e.g. Reshape), we can add it to the no_no_quantization_ops list:

            >>> no_quantization_ops = [tf.keras.layers.Reshape]
            >>> FrameworkInfo(kernel_ops, activation_ops, no_quantization_ops, kernel_channels_mapping, {}, {})

            If an activation layer (tf.keras.layers.Activation) should be quantized and we know it's min/max outputs range in advanced, we can add it to activation_min_max_mapping for saving the statistics collection time. For example:

            >>> activation_min_max_mapping = {'softmax': (0, 1)}
            >>> FrameworkInfo(kernel_ops, activation_ops, no_quantization_ops, kernel_channels_mapping, activation_min_max_mapping, {})

            If a layer's activations should be quantized and we know it's min/max outputs range in advanced, we can add it to layer_min_max_mapping for saving the statistics collection time. For example:

            >>> layer_min_max_mapping = {tf.keras.layers.Softmax: (0, 1)}
            >>> FrameworkInfo(kernel_ops, activation_ops, no_quantization_ops, kernel_channels_mapping, activation_min_max_mapping, layer_min_max_mapping)
