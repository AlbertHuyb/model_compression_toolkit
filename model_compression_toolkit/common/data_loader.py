        Args:
            folder: Path of folder with images to load. The path has to exist, and has to contain at
            least one image.
            preprocessing: List of functions to use when processing the images before retrieving them.

            file_types: Files types to scan in the folder. Default list is :data:`~model_compression_toolkit.common.data_loader.FILETYPES`

        Examples:

            Instantiate a FolderImageLoader using a directory of images, that returns 10 images randomly each time it is sampled:

            >>> image_data_loader = FolderImageLoader('path/to/images/directory', preprocessing=[], batch_size=10)

            For the FolderImageLoader to scan only specific files extensions, a list of extensions can be passed:
