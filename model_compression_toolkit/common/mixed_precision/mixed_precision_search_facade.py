    Search for a MP configuration for a given graph. Given a search_method method (by default, it's linear
    programming), we use the get_sensitivity_evaluation function to get a function to compute an
    evaluation for the expected sensitivity for a bit-width configuration.
    Then, and after computing the KPI for each node in the graph for each bit-width in the search space,
    we search for the optimal solution, given some target_kpi, the solution should fit.
    target_kpi have to be passed. If it was not passed, the facade is not supposed to get here by now.

    Args:
        graph_to_search_cfg: Graph to search a MP configuration for.
        mp_config: MixedPrecisionQuantizationConfigV2 the graph was prepared according to.
        fw_info: FrameworkInfo object about the specific framework (e.g., attributes of different layers' weights to quantize).
        target_kpi: Target KPI to bound our feasible solution space s.t the configuration does not violate it.
        get_sensitivity_evaluation: Function specific to the model's framework, which builds and returns
        a function that evaluates the sensitivity of a bit-width configuration for the MP model.
        search_method: BitWidthSearchMethod to define which searching method to use.

    Returns:
        A MP configuration for the graph (list of integers, where the index in the list, is the node's
        index in the graph, when the graph is topology sorted, and the value in this index is the
