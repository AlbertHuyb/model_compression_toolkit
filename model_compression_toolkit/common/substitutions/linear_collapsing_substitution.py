    Apply a list of linear collapsing substitutions on a graph.
    We run on the graph and find matches. For each valid match we do substitution.
    After each substitution we find matches again on the transformed graph to look for new matches.
    This is because a node can participate in more than one match so after substitution
    the matches are not valid anymore, and we can find new matches.
    Args:
        graph: Graph to transform.
        linear_collapsing_substitution: substitution to apply on the graph.
